## About Tic Tac Toe Game

It's game in which two players alternately put Xs and Os in compartments of a figure formed by two vertical lines crossing two horizontal lines and each tries to get a row of three Xs or three Os before the opponent does.

## RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE

The game is played on a grid that's n squares by n squares.
You are a shape you choose, your friend is another shape he chooses. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
The first player to get n of his/her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
When all squares are full, the game is over. If no player has n marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

## INSTRUCTIONS TO PLAY

- Write first players name and pick a shape and do the same for the second player
- Pick the size of the board you want to play with (number of rows)
- Choose a number from the grid to mark it with the player's symbol, then it's the turn of the next player to do the same.
- If a player gets n symbols in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. If all squares are full and none has the n symbols the game ends in a tie.
